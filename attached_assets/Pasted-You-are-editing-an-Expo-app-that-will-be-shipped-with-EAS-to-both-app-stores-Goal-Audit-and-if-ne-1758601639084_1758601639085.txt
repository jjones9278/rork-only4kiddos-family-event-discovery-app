You are editing an Expo app that will be shipped with EAS to both app stores.

Goal
Audit and, if needed, update build config so the project can be built and submitted to the App Store (TestFlight) and Google Play (Internal testing) without changing app logic.

Make these edits safely (idempotent):
1) app.config.ts (or app.json if that’s what the repo uses)
   - Ensure these fields are present and filled:
     name: "Only4Kiddos"
     slug: "only4kiddos"
     scheme: "only4kiddos"
     version: "1.0.0"
     ios.bundleIdentifier: "com.yourcompany.only4kiddos"          // replace with the real one
     android.package: "com.yourcompany.only4kiddos"               // replace with the real one
     ios.infoPlist.NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription: "We show relevant events near you."
     extra.eas.projectId is present (or add if missing)
   - Do not add NSUserTrackingUsageDescription unless the app truly uses cross-app tracking.

2) eas.json
   - Create or update with:
     {
       "cli": { "version": ">= 10.0.0" },
       "build": {
         "production": {
           "android": { "buildType": "app-bundle" },
           "ios": { "simulator": false }
         }
       },
       "submit": {
         "production": {
           "android": { "track": "internal" },
           "ios": {}
         }
       }
     }

3) Assets sanity check (no placeholders—only adjust paths if they already exist)
   - Confirm app icon path points to an existing 1024x1024 file (e.g., ./assets/icon.png).
   - Confirm splash/icon/adaptiveIcon references point to existing files on Android and iOS sections.

4) Permissions and descriptions
   - If the app uses location, ensure the iOS location string above is present.
   - Don’t add permissions you don’t use.

5) Environment
   - Leave EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL usage as-is.
   - No secrets should be in EXPO_PUBLIC_ variables.

6) Scripts (optional, only add if missing)
   - In package.json, ensure these exist but do not remove existing scripts:
     "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit",
     "lint": "eslint ."

Acceptance
- app.config.ts (or app.json) has valid bundleIdentifier (iOS) and package (Android), a scheme, and version.
- eas.json has a production profile for both platforms.
- Icon/splash/adaptive icons point to real files that exist.
- No tracking permission string added unless truly required.
- No runtime code changed.

Output
- Show a short diff of modified files.
- Print the relevant final sections of app.config.ts/app.json and eas.json.
